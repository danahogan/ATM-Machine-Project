This project represents an ATM machine with five pre-programmed users. To initiate the necessary .txt files, you must run the 'GetUserInfo.cpp' 
file. Afterwards, to 'start-up' the ATM, run 'ATM_Machine.cpp' and all the necessary .txt files will be input to the program. This is 
essentially loading the user data into various arrays to make them easily accessible. Finally, if you login as one of the users and complete 
a transaction, upon leaving the program (option 5 from the Main Menu), a new .txt file will overwrite the existing accountBalances.txt file
with the updated balances of all users saving and checking accounts. Of note, if you want to completely reset the account balances for all users,
you must run the 'GetUserInfo.cpp' file again to create the accountBalances.txt file with default balances.
